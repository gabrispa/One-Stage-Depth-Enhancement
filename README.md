# One-Stage-Depth-Enhancement

## 1. Create new environment using requirements.txt or OSDE.yml
## 2. To train a model from scratch, use train_current.py, pay attention to noise/erosion settings and dataset used to start the training (options at the first line of the file)
## 3. To start a fine tuning on the real dataset, use fine_tuning.py
## 4. To test for a given dataset, use test-[dataset].py

## CHECK YOUR DATASETS LOCATIONS AND CHANGE THE PATHS IN ALL THE DATALOADERS BEFORE STARTING ANY TRAINING
